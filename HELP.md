# A. General  / Infrastructural

This group determines the available resources such as hardware characteristics or OS version and settings, as well as current resource usage and PostgreSQL settings. This information helps to identify suboptimal settings and existing or potential issues related to environment where Postgres works. It may be used for creating recommendations for improving database performance. A-group also serves as a basis for some reports in other groups.

### A001 System, CPU, RAM, Virtualization

General information about operational systems where the observed Postgres master and its replicas operate.

> Insights:
> 
> - Hardware and software differences (OS versions, Linux kernel versions, CPU, Memory). If the observed master and its replicas run on different platforms, it might cause issues with binary replication.
>  
> - Memory settings tuning. (Examples: is swap enabled? Are huge pages used?) Observing state of memory about memory consumption by database may lead to recommendations of changes to improve system performance.
>  
> - Information about virtualization type.


### A002 Postgres Version Information

This report answers the following questions:
- Do all nodes have the same Postgres version?  
- Is the minor version being used up-to-date? Keeping the minor version of the database up-to-date is recommended to decrease chances to encounter with bugs, performance and security issues?
- Is the major version currently supported by the community?  
- Will the major version be supported by the community during the next 12 months?
- If the minor version is not the most recent, are any critical bugfixes released that need to be applied ASAP?


### A003 Postgres Settings

Shows all PostgreSQL settings and their values grouped into categories.
May be used as a quick reference.


### A004 Cluster Information

A quick overview of "what is happening with the observed Postgres nodes?".

The following is included:

- The uptime. Sometimes low uptime may indicate an unplanned, accidental restart of the database.
- General information: how many databases are on one instance, what is their size, replication mode, age of statistics.
- Information about replicas, replication modes, replication delays.
- Ratio of forced checkpoints among all checkpoints registered since statistics reset time. 
> Insights: Frequent checkpoints in most cases create an excessive load on the disk subsystem. Identifying this fact will allow the more optimal disk utilization. 
- How big is the observed database (the cluster may have multiple databases)? 
> Insight: if the database is smaller than RAM, there are good chances to avoid intensive disk IO in most operations 
- Cache Effectiveness: percentage of buffer pool hits. 
> Insight: if it is not more than 95% on all nodes, it might be a good sign that the buffer pool size needs to be increased.   
- Successful Commits: percentage of successfully committed transactions. 
> Insight: if the value is not more than 99%, it might be a sign of logic issues with application code leading to high rates of ROLLBACK events. 
- Temp Files per day: how many temporary files were generated per day in average, since last statistics reset time. Insight: if this value is high (thousands), it is a signal that work_mem should be increased.
- Deadlocks per day. 
> Insight: significant (dozens) daily number of deadlocks is a sign of issues with application logic that needs redesign. 

### A005 Extensions

Provides a list of all available and installed (in the current observed database) extensions, with versions. Insight: if there is a newer version of an installed extension, the report will highlight it, meaning that update is needed.

### A006 Postgres Setting Deviations

Helps to check that there are no differences in Postgres configuration on the observed nodes (except `transaction_read_only` and pg_stat_kcache’s `linux_hz`). 

> Insights:
> - In general, any differences in configuration on master and its replicas might lead to issues in case of failover. An example: the master is tuned, while replicas are not tuned at all or tuned poorly, in the event of failover, a new master cannot operate properly due to poor tuning.


### A007 Altered Settings

There are multiple ways to change database settings globally:

- explicitly, in the configuration file postgresql.conf, and
- implicitly, using 'ALTER SYSTEM' commands.

This report checks if there are settings which were set by implicit (ALTER SYSTEM) way.  

Possible sources of configuration settings (presented in the first column of the report’s table):

* `postgresql.auto.conf`: Changed via 'ALTER SYSTEM' command.
* `%any other file pattern%`: Changed in additional config included to the main one.
* `postgresql.conf`: Non-default values are set in postgresql.conf.  
* 
### A008 Disk Usage and File System Type

Shows detailed file systems information related to Postgres database.
 
> Insights:
> - Is there enough free disk space?
> - Are there no network file systems for Postgres such as NFS? Use of a network file system reduces the performance of the database and might lead to data corruption.
> - Is stats_temp_directory located in RAM (tmpfs)? The default location of the statistics collector directory inside PGDATA, so it might create excessive load on the disk subsystem.
> - Are file systems equal across all observed nodes (comparing master with replicas)?

### A010 Data Checksums, wal_log_hints

This report gives understanding, how securely the database stores data.

> Insights:
> - When the checksums are enabled, the pg_verify_checksums utility can be used (added in version 11; renamed to pg_checksums in version 12).
> - pg_rewind utility requires wal_log_hints to be turned on (default value is off).
# D. Monitoring / Troubleshooting

Reports of this group help to understand if the database configuration settings for collecting statistics are correct. Without statistics, monitoring systems will not be able to function well.


### D002 Useful Linux Tools

Checks if some common diagnostics Linux tools are installed on the system.

> Insights:
> This check shows which helpful troubleshooting utilities are installed on the host.
> It is worth having at least one or two utilities in every category (memory, CPU, network, I/O, etc.).
> Such tools should be installed in advance to diagnose incidents in a timed fashion.


### D004 pg_stat_statements, Tuning opts, pg_stat_kcache

Checks if the extensions for SQL query analysis are available and installed in the
current database: pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_kcache.
If extenstions are available, their settings will be shown.

> Insights:
> - Query analysis reports (section K) require at least pg_stat_statements be installed.
> - In addition, pg_stat_statements are used by most monitoring systems.
> - Inspection of pg_stat_statements is essential for correct query analysis.
> - For example, `pg_stat_statements.track = all` might double some SQL queries if stored procedures are used (to avoid duplicates and understand workload correctly, `top` should be used; however, it will exclude in-function SQL statements).


# F. Autovacuum, Bloat

For the effective work of the database we need up-to-date statistics and no index- and tables bloat. In this case, the autovacuum must have the correct settings. It is also important to understand if autovacuum functions well or not and if more or less aggressive tuning is required.

### F001 Autovacuum: Current Settings

Shows autovacuum-related Postgres settings and per-table autovacuum tuning (if applied).  
Answers the following questions: 
- Is any tuning applied (values are not default)?
- Are there any custom table autovacuum settings? There are cases when the tables have a custom autovacuum configuration. Tracking such tables will allow you to better understand the nature of the functioning of autovacuum workers.
### F002 Autovacuum: Transaction Wraparound check

Shows a distance in % to transaction wraparound disaster for each database.
If % is higher than 50%, you must consider tuning autovacuum settings as soon as possible. By identifying objects that are older than the set threshold, settings for adjusting the auto-vacuum settings will be suggested.

### F003 Autovacuum: Dead Tuples

The main metric in a table is "Dead Tuples Ratio, %" shows the percentage of dead tuples in the tables.  
The column "Since the last autovacuum" gives understanding about the effectiveness of the autovacuum tuning.


### F004, F005 Autovacuum: Heap Bloat, Index Bloat (Estimated)

Shows total estimated tables bloat for observed database and percentage per table. 
Objects with a high percentage of bloat lead to a decrease in query performance, additional CPU costs, and excessive read load on the disk. The same applies to indexes.

Checks the following things:
- If there is no extreme (>90%) level of heap bloat estimated 
- If there is no significant (>40%) level of heap bloat estimated 

This report is based on estimations. The errors in bloat estimates may be significant (in some cases, up to 15% and event more). Use it only as an indicator of potential issues.

### F008 Autovacuum: Resource Usage

Shows a table with Postgres settings related to autovacuum resource usage.  

Answers the following questions:   
- Is  `autovacuum_max_workers`  not default? (when CPU cores >= 16)
- Is `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` / `vacuum_cost_limit` not default?
- Isn't `maintenance_work_mem` / `autovacuum_work_mem` too low?


# G. Performance / Connections / Memory-related Settings

### G001 Memory-related Settings

Shows Postgres settings related to memory usage. Memory management in PostgreSQL is important for improving the performance of the database server. We can suggest changing these parameters values to achieve better performance. This report answer  the questions:  
- Are the Resource Consumption parameters tuned? 
- Is the level of OOM risks low or high?  
- Is memory usage correct?  

### G002 Connections and Current Activity

A detailed snapshot of all connections, grouped by users, databases and state type.
Helps to detect the count of not good conditions like:
 
- idle in the transaction. Are there any "idle in transaction" connections with state changed more than 1 hour ago, or with transaction age more than 1 hour?
- long active connections. Are there any  "actives"  > 1 hour?
- reaching to `max_connections`

### G003 Timeouts, Locks, Deadlocks

Provides information about how "timeouts" and "locks" are tuned, shows deadlocks counter for every database since statistics reset.

Answers the questions:  
- Is statement_timeout not 0 and <= 30 seconds (best choice for an OLTP system)?
- Is idle_in_transaction_session_timeout < 20 minutes (autovacuum and locking issues)?
- Is max_locks_per_transaction not default (for example, low value may interrupt pg_dump)?

# K. SQL Query Analysis

This group of checks provides you with the analysis of all the most frequent queries within `pg_stat_statements.max.

### K001 Globally Aggregated Query Metrics

Aggregated statistics about all queries performed during the observation period.
The most interesting metric is `s/sec` ("seconds per second") in the "Total time" column - it shows roughly how many CPU cores are utilized by queries. `30s/sec` means "30 CPUs were processed queries". May help with capacity planning.

### K002 Workload type ("First-word" Analysis)

Helps to understand which type of workload is the most frequent (selects, inserts, updates, etc.) during the observation period.
Only analyses the first word of a query.

### K003 Top-50 Queries by total_time

One of the most interesting reports. Shows TOP-50 query groups ordered by total execution time during the observation period. Good start for query optimization.  
It answers the question: Do we have any query groups which total_time is >50% of overall total_time? If we have this type of query - it is time to optimize.
Full query text is available by the link above each query group.

# H. Index Analysis

### H001 Invalid Indexes

The list of broken indexes (invalid state) to be removed or reindexed.

### H002 Unused and Redundant Indexes

Shows never used, rarely used and redundant indexes.
Helps to understand how much space they occupy.
Notices about statistics age (we can't rely on short lifetime).

It's good to check:
- Is the total size of unused indexes less than 10% of the DB size (only if statistics is older than 1 week)
- Is statistics saved across restarts?

### H003 Non-indexed Foreign Keys

Checks if all foreign keys have indexes in referencing tables.  

# L. DB Schema Analysis

The reports of this group are designed for architectural checks, which are crucial for making decisions on changing the structure of the database in the face of a growing amount of data.

### L001 Table Sizes

Displays the size of tables and their components (indexes, toast, the table itself).  

Answers the questions:
- Does the size of indexes for each table not exceed heap (with toast) size? 
- Are there any non-indexes tables which size is > 10 MiB?  
- Are there any non-partitioned tables of size > 100 GiB?

### L003 Integer (int2, int4) Out-of-range Risks in PKs

Shows primary keys with risks of integer capacity overflow (reached above 10%). If the capacity of the primary key is exhausted, this will most likely lead to the shutdown of the service.
This report helps to protect the database from disaster on integer overflow.
